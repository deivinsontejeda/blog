Has been a year with many changes, the most important (I think) was get out of my country. Now I'm living in Santiago Chile, a beatiful country that received me. A year later, still I'm learning so many stuff about inmigration life.

I lost all my previous posts :-( (although anyone read it)

I hope to write a bit more with main idea to leave this blog like a repositories of notes.
